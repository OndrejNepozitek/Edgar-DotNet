However, that might not always be what we want. For example, we may think that it is more aesthetically pleasing to have gaps between rooms, or we may use a a tileset that does not work if the outline overlap.

            //md It is possible to configure the minimum distance between individual rooms using the `MinimumRoomDistance` property of level descriptions. By default, this distance is set to 0, but it can be set to any non-negative number. The only thing to keep in mind is that the greater the minimum distance, the more constrained is the generator, which may significantly worsen the performance. However, setting the minimum distance to 1 or 2 should be almost always okay.
